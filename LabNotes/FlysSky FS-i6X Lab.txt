     (a) As delievered Default Settings
         (i) FSX firmware version 1.0 20-SEP-2019 HARD_Ver:V1.0
	     (ii) Factory reset (good)
         (iii) Firmware update (good)
         (iv) Same as (i)

     (b) Power-On at 0.6 to 1.1 amperes.
         (i) Battery indicator manual section 2.2.2.
             Indicator flucuating along with
             the current (could be searching
             for a link).
         (ii) FS-iA6B battery TX.V1(5.14 <-> 6.27)V (Volts)

     (c) * FS-iA6B:ON * FS-i6X:OFF *
          (i) FS-iA6B Receiver on.
              Blinking LED.

     (d) FS-iA6B:ON FS-i6X:ON 
          (i) FS-iA6B Receiver on.
          (ii) FS-i6X on. Panel Flashing.
          (iii) Receiver LED no longer blinking.
          (iv) FS-i6X Panel indicated made connection
               to receiver - no binding necessary.
		  (v) FS-i6X Panel has both battery indicators:
		      One for the FS-i6X and one for the receiver.
		  (vi) FSX battery indicator has less flucuations
               on average of 0.6 amps.
			   
 --------------------- (a-d) OK

	 (e) PWM, PPM, i-BUS FS-iA6B transceiver outputs
         Manual: Could NOT find any information from FLYSKY on 
                 Pulse Width Modulation nor Frequencies except
                 what was located in the FS-i6X Panel.
                 
	     (i) Manual section 8.10 Servos Freq is completely USSLESS.
		 (ii) FS-i6X Panel: RX setup - Output mode
         -------------------------------------------------
                   Output                 Serial
		 -------------------------------------------------
                  --> PWM              --> i-BUS       
                      PPM                  S.BUS
               **** LAB **** Only PWM will be tested
     Receiver:
     PWM - Channels 1-6 vertical connections...    
     i-BUS horizonal connection...
     REASON FOR TEST: To test the (1) GIMBALS (JOYSTICKS) 
                                  (2) POTENTIOMETERS (Knobs)
                                  (3) SWITCHES
     For manufacturing defects, assembling mistakes, or shipping handling damage...

     (f) Panel: System - RX Setup - Servos freq: 50 
                Assume to be in the unit (Hz) this sequence is repeated every 20ms
                                    **** Lab **** Only default 50Hz will be tested
         Manual section 8.10 Servos Freq is completely USSLESS

See Arduino Uno sketch for further details.... 

SIMULATION - Arduino Uno - Serial Debug
             PlatformIO (VS Code) on Windows PC
FS-i6X - 6V DC Power Supply
FS-iA6B - 5V DC Power Supply

TEST-RESULTS FOR RIGHT GIMBAL (JOYSTICK) - OK
Lab Test Ends here for right gimbal...
